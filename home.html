            <h2 class="font-weight-light mb-0"><br>Go-Dutch is a website where you can browse cars that are not used by their owners for a period of time, and you can lease a variety of secondhand cars while paying a small shipping cost while we switch your car within the same lease period.
                &nbsp; Respectively, you have your filtering options, a catalog of cars where you can save cars you want into your cart, and a section where you can see what cars are in your cart along with costs/discounts and
                checkout option. The name Go-Dutch comes from the expression going Dutch which means splitting the cost equally. Go-Dutch allows users to lease their dream cars by going Dutch on the lease with others month by month.<br><br><br>U.S. geo-planning
                has mostly been done in consideration of highways and millions of people would commute to work everyday before COVID-19. Now during lockdowns, the amount of people working from home can go up to 42% according to Stanford Economics Department.
                If 42% of people aren’t going outside, applying the same ratio shows that the amount of stationary cars is nearly 115 million. Given that, according to Bureau of Transportation Statistics, each household has 1.88 cars, so most families
                can get their essential needs met with only one car. So in order to make Americans a bit of extra cash with their idle cars, we let them lease their cars for longer periods to others. Someone who wants to lease a car can browse other people’s
                cars and have it for a period of time.This is the purpose of my hypothetical platform Go-Dutch. I made a React demo for how people can pick the cars they want and the monthly lease cost for the car. A person can have more than one car
                during their lease period, and this way if they want a shiny sports car they don’t have to pay the lease for it for a year. Instead the monthly cost will be the average monthly lease cost for all the cars the user picks per month. Every
                time people switch their cars Go-Dutch will make sure the new car is delivered on time with cleaning and disinfecting finished, and the previous car they had is brought to a new leaser or the original owner at the end of lease. So you
                could say this is Airbnb for cars in a way.<br></h2>

            <p><br>There are three ways to filter the cars you want to browse: category, brand, and increasing/decreasing price. The initial setting will be showing cars from low price to high price(increasing) with all the different categories and brands
                showing at once. The selected filtering options will show at the top, and “All” will be selected at first. If the user wants to go back to the initial state of browsing, all they need to do is pick all again and bring sorting to increasing
                if changed. All the user needs to do to add a car to cart is press the button below the car picture.<br><br><br></p><img class="d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center align-self-center m-auto visible" src="assets/img/Screen%20Shot%202020-11-29%20at%207.25.49%20PM.png"

            <p><br>For the sake of usability I focused on Nielsen principles. I have as little text as possible. Pictures are large since the pictures of the cars are more prominent while picking cars. The structure of the page is meant to be familiar from
                almost every e-commerce site and button use symbols as much as possible to be more universal. However, things still need to be explained in English since the target audience are adults, and details is needed for such financial decisions.&nbsp;
                Add To Cart button applies to this principle, since the button says what it does for clarity, but also intuitive since the button starts with “+.” I used a mostly blue light color scheme for a calming impression and a general aesthetic
                that is easy on the eyes so the user can focus on the car pictures. For new users there are some help for how to navigate through the website between different components.<br><br><br></p>

                    <p><br>In conclusion, React was very powerful in writing this website efficiently, and my biggest takeaway from the project has been how to use React hooks instead of class components. Also, this project allowed me to make a demo for
                        a start-up idea which could actually be executed as many companies are expected to let employees work from home after the pandemic as well.<br></p>
